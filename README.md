# hello-world
first step in learning git 
I am currently working o my data strustures and algorithm skills. I code in c++.I practice online in competitive coding websites.
I then realised that devoloping projects is an essential skill.
So, I am here, hoping to contribute as much as I can and learn how to solve the problems that arise while applying, along the way.
